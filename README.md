# InterestingCppFeatures
Place where I will test some cpp features with examples how they work.
#How to build
You need to have cmake installed, than run terminal/cmd. Last thing is typing "cmake $Path_to_repo" and you should see solution being  made.
#Problems with building
If you have problems with building check if you selected right project that is being runned and check if you are using at least C++17.
